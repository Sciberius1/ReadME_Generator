## Description
This is a simple README.md Generator to be used to add license information to your favorite project, and create a professional looking README (instructions file) that you can copy and paste into your own project folder or email to your favorite coder to have a project built for you.

## Installation
- Use the green 'Code' button to download the code in zip format.
- Unzip the file and open the folder in an easy to access location.
- Open the terminal in that folder and run 'npm i' to install the code.

## Usage
- Run 'node index.js' in the terminal and answer the prompts. 
- A README.md file will be generated in the same folder as the code. 
- It will replace any existing README.md file in the folder, including this one if it is not renamed.
- Once you have generated the README.md file, you can copy and paste it into your own project folder to be uploaded to GitHub or compressed and emailed to your favorite coder to have a project built for you.

## Contributing
You may create forks from this project if you want to modify it in GitHub for your own purposes. If you are downloading and then modifying the code before deploying it somewhere else, please remember to acknowledge the original code to any modifications or alterations of this code in your future projects.

## Tests
When the README.md is generated, open it in a markdown viewer to ensure that the links work properly and you like the way it looks. Use your favorite text editor to ensure that the text is formatted properly and worded to your liking.

You may include markdown shortcuts in your answers to the prompts to format the text in the generated README.md file, but it is suggested that you edit any such fields in the generated README.md in a text editor file to ensure that the text is formatted properly and worded to your liking.

Like all other README.md files, this one can be edited using HTML to add a litte flair to the text. If you want to add graphics ensure that you use the full URL to the image in the markdown link, or use a relative path to the image if you are going to be uploading the README.md file to a GitHub repository. You may also use UTF-8 encoding to add emojis to the text.
